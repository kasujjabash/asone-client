/**
 * Routes.
 *
 * Sign-in is one route covering both steps: password, then the emailed code.
 * A separate URL for the code step could be landed on with no challenge to
 * answer.
 *
 * Every sidebar destination is registered here, generated from the same
 * navigation model the sidebar draws from — so a link can never point at a
 * route that does not exist, and adding a destination is one entry in one
 * file. Screens that are built are listed in SCREENS; the rest get the
 * placeholder until their design arrives.
 *
 * Each is wrapped twice, and the order matters: RequireAuth first, because
 * "who are you" precedes "may you do this", and RequireAccess second so it
 * can rely on there being a user to ask about.
