/**
 * Who may see what.
 *
 * Pure predicates over a user. No fetching, no components — so a test can
 * assert the whole navigation model without rendering anything.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does not do:
 *
 *   It does not name roles. AsOne's access matrix is served by the backend
 *   as seven boolean columns per role; asking `can(user, 'school_orders')`
 *   means a change to one cell of that matrix stays a backend change. A
 *   frontend that branches on `role === 'FINANCE'` has copied the matrix,
 *   and the copy goes stale silently.
 *
 *   It does not decide which *rows* a user sees. That is `scope_to_user_site`
 *   on the server, it is invisible from here, and a warehouse clerk's list
 *   request simply comes back containing their own site only. Never filter a
 *   scoped list client-side, and never read an empty list as an error — it
 *   may be a correct, scoped, empty answer.
 *
 * All of this is advisory. Hiding a control is cosmetic; the server re-checks
 * every request, so a 403 is always possible and must still be handled.
