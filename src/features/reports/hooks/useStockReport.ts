/**
 * The stock report's data.
 *
 * Three requests: stock levels, reorder alerts and the SKU catalogue. The
 * first two accept both `as_of` and `warehouse`, so the report answers for
 * any date at any site.
 *
 * The warehouse comes from the shell's filter rather than a local one, so the
 * top bar and the report's own control cannot disagree.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why not /dashboard/summary/
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It would answer three of the four tiles in one call, and the dashboard uses
 * it for exactly that. But it takes only `warehouse` — there is no `as_of` —
 * so it always reports now. On a screen with a date filter that produced a
 * page contradicting itself: "16,482 units available" above a table showing
 * stock as at a date when there was none.
 *
 * So the report derives its own figures from dated sources and is internally
 * consistent at any date. The cost is summing units and value on the client,
 * which is worth it here because no endpoint totals stock as at a past date.
 *
 * The SKU catalogue is not optional. `/inventory/stock-levels/` returns a row
 * only where the ledger has movements, and `?include_zero=true` does not
 * change that — verified: 33 active SKUs, 2 with stock, and the flag returns
 * the same 2. The catalogue is what tells this screen a SKU exists at all,
 * and without it the report cannot show what is out of stock.
