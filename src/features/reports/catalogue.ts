/**
 * The reports index — Figma 58:2797.
 *
 * The design lists twenty-three reports in four categories. Nine of them map
 * to something the server can answer today; the rest do not exist, and
 * several describe things the domain has no concept of at all — drivers,
 * vehicles, grants, subsidies, per-size pricing.
 *
 * All twenty-three are listed anyway, because a reports index is a statement
 * of intent as much as a menu, and quietly dropping fourteen would make the
 * gap invisible to whoever has to close it. What is not built says so and
 * cannot be clicked.
 *
 * `endpoint` is recorded on the live ones so nobody has to work out where a
 * figure comes from, and `note` on the dead ones says what is missing —
 * those notes are the list to take to AsOne.
