/**
 * The order list, for the design's four tabs.
 *
 * Three of the tabs are one status and so one request. "In Progress" spans
 * two — RELEASED and PICKED — and the server's filter takes a single exact
 * value (`filterset_fields = ("status", "order_date")`), so that tab issues
 * one request per status and merges them.
 *
 * The merge pages on the client, which is only sound because it fetches
 * every page of both statuses first. That is fine at AsOne's volume and
 * would not be at ten times it. The fix is `?status__in=` on the server,
 * after which this collapses back to a single query like the others.
 *
 * Fifteen rows a page. The server used to fix every list at fifty;
 * `config/pagination.py` now accepts `?page_size=`, so the screen asks for
 * what it draws instead of fetching fifty and slicing — which would have left
 * the page numbers describing something other than what was on screen.
