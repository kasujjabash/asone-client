/**
 * What each screen means — the content behind the Help button.
 *
 * Written because this system has rules nobody guesses from the interface.
 * An order cannot be picked before Finance confirms payment; the stock
 * ledger is append-only so nothing is ever edited, only offset; a van goes
 * to a school rather than to an order. A clerk who does not know those will
 * read a refusal as a bug.
 *
 * Plain data, no React, so the wording can be reviewed by somebody who does
 * not read code — and so it can be handed to AsOne to correct. Everything
 * here describes behaviour that exists today; where a thing is deliberately
 * not built, it says so rather than staying silent.
