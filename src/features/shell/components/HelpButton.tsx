/**
 * The Help control in the top bar.
 *
 * Context help: it explains **the screen you are on**, not the system in
 * general. This system refuses things for reasons a person cannot guess from
 * the interface — an order that will not pick because Finance has not
 * confirmed payment, a backorder offering View TC instead of Release — and a
 * refusal you cannot explain reads as a bug.
 *
 * The button was previously wired to nothing at all, which is worse than
 * absent: people press it, nothing happens, and they stop trusting the other
 * controls.
 *
 * Content lives in `help.ts` as plain data, so it can be reviewed and
 * corrected by somebody who does not read code — and kept in step as screens
 * change.
