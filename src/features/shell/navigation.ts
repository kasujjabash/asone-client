/**
 * The navigation model.
 *
 * One entry per destination, each declaring which column of AsOne's access
 * matrix it needs. Nothing here branches on a role name, so a change to one
 * cell of that matrix stays a change on the server.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is a superset, not a copy of the design
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The dashboard frame (Figma 2001:424) draws every item unconditionally, and
 * its user footer reads "Warehouse Lead". Taken literally it belongs to no
 * single role: it contains **Orders**, which is School Staff only, and
 * **Inv. Adjustments**, which the matrix reserves for Finance and denies to
 * both leads. Drawing it as-is would put two guaranteed 403s in a Program
 * Lead's sidebar.
 *
 * So the design is read as the full set of destinations, and each role sees
 * the subset it holds. A Program Lead gets everything here except Orders and
 * Inv. Adjustments; a warehouse clerk gets receiving, shipments, backorders
 * and inventory; a school clerk gets orders and little else.
 *
 * Hiding an item is cosmetic — the server re-checks every request — but a
 * navigation that leads somewhere forbidden is worse than one that is quiet.
