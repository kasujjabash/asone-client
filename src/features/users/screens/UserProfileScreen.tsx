/**
 * One person's account — what it is, and the four things a lead can do to it.
 *
 * Every one of these already existed on the server and none had a screen, so
 * a forgotten password meant somebody editing the database by hand. That is
 * the gap this fills, and it is why "Set a new password" is the first action
 * rather than the last.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The four actions, in the order they are usually wanted
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   **Set a new password** — they have forgotten it. Shown once, never
 *   emailed, and it signs them out everywhere.
 *   **Sign out everywhere** — a laptop left open somewhere. The password is
 *   still trusted, only the sessions are the problem.
 *   **Deactivate** — they have left. Never a delete: past receipts, picks
 *   and adjustments name them, and an account that vanishes takes the
 *   audit trail with it.
 *   **Edit** — a typo in a name, a move to another warehouse, a change of
 *   role.
 *
 * All four are confirmed through the shared `ConfirmButton`, because all
 * four are things somebody else finds out about when they cannot sign in.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Role and site move together
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A warehouse clerk needs a warehouse and a school clerk a school; the two
 * leads and Finance take neither, and the server refuses any other
 * combination. So changing the role clears the site, and the site field is
 * only drawn when the chosen role has one — the same rule the Add User
 * wizard follows.
