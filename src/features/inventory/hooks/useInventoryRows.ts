/**
 * Inventory Overview's rows — one per SKU per warehouse.
 *
 * Four reads, joined on the client: the SKU catalogue (garment, size,
 * active flag), the garments themselves (colour, school level — a SKU
 * carries only `garment_name`, not the garment's own fields), stock levels
 * (available, reserved, value — summed from the ledger on read, see
 * `StockLevel`), and the configured minimum per SKU per warehouse.
 *
 * Seeded from the SKU catalogue rather than from stock levels alone, the
 * same reasoning as the stock report's `toLedgerRows`: `/inventory/stock-levels/`
 * returns a row only where the ledger has movements, so a SKU never stocked
 * would otherwise be missing rather than shown at zero.
 *
 * `shipped` has no server aggregation to read (unlike `level` and
 * `reserved`, which `/inventory/stock-levels/` already sums) — computed here
 * instead, from the same ledger the app already exposes: every SHIPMENT
 * posts a positive SHIPPED-status row (orders/services/shipping.py,
 * backorders.py), so summing those per SKU per warehouse is the same
 * arithmetic the server would do, just run client-side.
 *
 * `fetchShippedTotals` pages through the whole SHIPMENT ledger for the
 * warehouse(s) in scope — capped at `MAX_PAGES` (4,000 rows) as a sane
 * limit for this system's current size. If AsOne's shipment history ever
 * grows past that, this sum belongs server-side next to `level`/`reserved`
 * in `inventory/services.py: stock_levels` instead of paging the ledger from
 * the browser.
