/**
 * A dashboard KPI tile — Figma 2001:802.
 *
 * The only KPI tile in the app. The design system's §06 `StatCard` was a
 * second one — icon paired with the label rather than the figure — but
 * nothing ever rendered it, so it and its stylesheet section were deleted
 * rather than left as a second card figure for somebody to pick up by
 * mistake. Anything wanting a figure on a card uses this.
 *
 * `value` is a string. Every figure on this screen is either formatted money
 * or a formatted count, and neither should arrive as a raw number.
 *
 * `to` makes the tile a link. Optional, because most figures have nowhere
 * useful to go — a tile that navigates somewhere unrelated is worse than one
 * that does nothing. Where a figure *is* a to-do list, the number is the most
 * obvious thing to click, and it should look clickable rather than only
 * behave that way.
