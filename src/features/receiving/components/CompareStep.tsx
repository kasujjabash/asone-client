/**
 * Step 3 — what the paper said against what was counted off the van.
 *
 * The one screen where the warehouse does the job AsOne's flow (p.5) asks
 * of it: check the delivery, resolve the differences, and only then commit.
 *
 * Two rules this screen exists to hold:
 *
 *   **A difference is shown, never resolved.** The count and the expected
 *   figure stay as two numbers. Nothing here averages them or quietly takes
 *   the larger — the gap is the finding.
 *
 *   **A zero net is not the same as a clean delivery.** Ten short on one
 *   size and ten over on another nets to nothing and is two errors. The
 *   summary says so rather than showing a reassuring 0.
