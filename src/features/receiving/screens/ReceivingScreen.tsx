/**
 * Receiving — F19, F20, F21.
 *
 * Owns the wizard's state and nothing else: the arithmetic is in
 * `domain/receiving`, the requests are in `api/procurement`, and each step
 * is a presentational component that takes what it draws.
 *
 * ## Why "Expected" is sent as the packing list quantity
 *
 * The server models three separate facts — what was ordered, what the
 * Tailoring Center's handwritten list claimed, and what was counted. This
 * screen collects two of them: the outstanding quantity on the production
 * order (Expected) and the physical count (Received).
 *
 * The design's step 2 captures the packing list as a *number* rather than a
 * per-SKU quantity, so there is no third column to fill. Expected is
 * therefore sent as `quantity_on_packing_list`, which makes the server's own
 * `discrepancy` the same figure as the Diff column on screen — the document
 * and the display cannot drift apart.
 *
 * **That is an assumption worth confirming with AsOne**: it reads the paper
 * as agreeing with the order. If a TC ever writes down a quantity that
 * differs from both the order and the count, this flow records two of those
 * three numbers and loses the middle one. Capturing it needs a per-SKU
 * column on step 2, which the design does not draw.
