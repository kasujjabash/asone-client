/**
 * Owns the session.
 *
 * Three things happen here that nowhere else can:
 *
 *   On boot it asks `/auth/me/` who the stored token belongs to, so a
 *   reload does not sign anyone out. Until that answers, the status is
 *   'loading' and no screen may claim the visitor is anonymous — rendering
 *   sign-in for half a second before a session resolves is how an app looks
 *   broken.
 *
 *   It subscribes to the transport's two failure signals, which need
 *   opposite handling. `onSessionExpired` means the refresh token was
 *   rejected: sign out and say so. `onServerUnreachable` means the request
 *   never landed: keep the session, because nothing about it is wrong, and
 *   tell the user the server is not answering. Treating the second as the
 *   first used to sign people out whenever the backend restarted.
 *
 *   It distinguishes 'gated' from 'signedIn'. An account with
 *   `must_change_password` is authenticated but gets 403 on almost
 *   everything, so the app must treat it as a separate state rather than a
 *   signed-in user who happens to see errors everywhere.
