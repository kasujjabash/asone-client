/**
 * Sign in — both steps.
 *
 * One route, two steps. The design draws them as separate screens, but they
 * are one sequence: a code screen reachable on its own URL could be landed on
 * with no challenge to answer, which is a dead end that has to be handled.
 * Which step shows is decided by the session's status, so that cannot happen.
