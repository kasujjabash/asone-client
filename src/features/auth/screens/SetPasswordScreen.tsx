/**
 * Replace the password you were handed — the gate between signing in and
 * using the system.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this screen had to exist
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The server refuses **every** request from an account with
 * `must_change_password` set, with `403 "Set a new password before using the
 * system."` Every account starts that way: a lead creates one, hands over a
 * password they also know, and the account is not that person's until they
 * replace it.
 *
 * The client knew this — `AuthProvider` has computed a `gated` status since
 * the beginning — and then let a gated user straight into the dashboard,
 * where all fourteen requests 403'd. What they saw was "Your dashboard could
 * not be loaded", an empty sidebar, and no way forward. It looked like a
 * broken account rather than one step they had not taken; the account was
 * fine and nothing told them what to do.
 *
 * So `RequireAuth` now sends a gated user here, and this screen is the only
 * thing they can reach until the gate clears.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It does not ask for the current password
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `/auth/password/change/` normally requires it, so that a stolen access
 * token alone cannot lock the owner out of their own account. This screen is
 * the one place that reasoning does not hold, and the server makes the field
 * optional for exactly this state:
 *
 *   * The one-time password was typed on the sign-in form seconds ago.
 *     There is no other way to have got here, so asking again is asking the
 *     same question twice in a row.
 *   * The gate blocks every other endpoint, so a session in the wrong hands
 *     can do one thing — set a password. The field would only stop somebody
 *     reaching an unlocked screen inside that window.
 *   * It stops nothing at all with respect to the lead who set the account
 *     up: they chose the one-time password and could sign in directly.
 *
 * So it costs a retype at the moment a new user is least sure of themselves
 * and buys close to nothing. Two fields: the new password, and it again.
 *
 * The response carries a fresh token pair, which `api/auth.changePassword`
 * stores — the old ones are blacklisted server-side the moment the password
 * changes, so without that the user is signed out the instant they succeed.
