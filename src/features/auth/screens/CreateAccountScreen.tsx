/**
 * Create Account — two states, one route.
 *
 * 1. The form: first name, last name, email, phone.
 * 2. Submitted: confirmation that a lead's review is next. Credentials
 *    follow by email once a lead approves and assigns a role — the same
 *    confirmation `POST /auth/users/` sends today.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * There is no "verify your email" step
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * There used to be: submitting emailed a six-digit code the registrant typed
 * back, and until they did, no lead could see the request. Removed 15
 * September 2026 at ERA 92's request.
 *
 * It was doing less than it looked like. A lead approves every request by
 * hand and nothing exists until one does, and approval emails that address
 * the account's own credentials — so an address nobody holds fails there,
 * before anyone can sign in. Meanwhile a code in a spam folder left a
 * request nobody could see and nobody could resend.
 *
 * See `accounts.services.request_registration`.
