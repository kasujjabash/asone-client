/**
 * Welcome — the way into the system.
 *
 * Brand deck on the left, an invitation on the right. Two ways on: start
 * onboarding, or sign in with an account you already have.
 *
 * "Get Started Onboarding" leads to the registration form. It creates no
 * account: `POST /auth/register/` records a request and emails a code to
 * prove the address. A Program Lead or Operations Manager then approves it
 * and assigns the role — which is the point the account actually exists,
 * because every transaction in this system records who performed it, and
 * nobody self-assigns what they are allowed to do.
