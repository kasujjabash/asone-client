/**
 * Schools with orders picked and waiting — F42's despatch queue.
 *
 * AsOne's checklist asks for a *"consolidated weekly despatch"*: one van to a
 * school carrying every order of theirs that is ready. So the queue is
 * grouped by school rather than listed by order — the unit of work is the
 * van, and the button loads it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * It says so when it is empty, rather than disappearing
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This used to `return null` with nothing picked, on the reasoning that an
 * empty panel above a full table is furniture. That reasoning was wrong about
 * what this panel is: it is not a summary of the table below, it is the
 * **only** place in the app a van is loaded.
 *
 * So vanishing made "how do I despatch?" answerable only by already knowing.
 * Somebody looking for it found an empty screen, no control, and no clue that
 * the missing step was upstream — a picked order. Now it names the condition.
 *
 * Still hidden for a role that may not despatch at all: telling somebody
 * about a control they will never be allowed is noise, not help.
