/**
 * Shipping — the picking backlog, F38.
 *
 * The landing view of the Shipments destination: what the warehouse has to
 * pull off the shelves, most urgent first, and the three counts above it.
 *
 * Two views share this destination — the backlog and what has already gone
 * out — so they share a tab strip. Both designs show the same sidebar item
 * selected, which is what tabs mean; an earlier version used a text link
 * reading "View despatched shipments", which was neither a pattern this
 * system has nor wording anybody asked for.
 *
 * ## Two things the design shows that cannot exist
 *
 * **"In Progress".** `pick_order` is atomic on the server — an order is
 * picked or it is not — because a half-finished reservation would let the
 * ledger say stock is committed to an order nobody completed. Whether
 * picking should be resumable is AsOne's open question Q4 ("can an order be
 * part-shipped?"), still unanswered. Until it is, an in-progress badge would
 * be a state nothing could reach.
 *
 * So the middle tile counts orders **picked and waiting for a van**, which
 * is the real thing sitting between ready and gone.
 *
 * **Per-line checkboxes with a 4/7 progress bar.** Same reason. The printed
 * pick list is the sheet a clerk ticks; the system records the outcome.
