/**
 * Shipments — F41, F42.
 *
 * What has left the warehouses, newest first, with the design's filter band
 * and numbered pagination.
 *
 * The design's four statuses are two. A shipment row does not exist until
 * despatch creates it, so nothing is ever "Preparing" or "Ready" — before
 * despatch there are only orders waiting to be picked, which is the despatch
 * queue below, a different table. See `domain/shipping.ts`.
