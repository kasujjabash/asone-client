/**
 * School detail — header, KPIs, and sections.
 *
 * The header, Active Orders, Status, and the Orders tab are all real now.
 * Orders became buildable once the backend widened `SchoolOrderViewSet` to
 * let both leads read the list (9 September 2026, pending AsOne's written
 * confirmation) and added a `?school=` filter alongside it — see
 * `orders/views.py`. Before that, this tab showed an honest "not available
 * for this role" message, which was correct at the time but is stale now
 * that the underlying access actually changed.
 *
 * Total Students remains a gap: there is no student roster anywhere in the
 * system (a student is a free-text name on an order, not a record). Total
 * Revenue and Pending Shipments are left as gaps too for now even though the
 * same order list this screen now fetches could answer both — worth wiring
 * once that's confirmed wanted, rather than doing it silently alongside an
 * unrelated fix. Students, Shipments and Backorders (the tabs) are gaps for
 * the same reasons as before — see TAB_GAPS.
 *
 * Earlier drafts of this screen filled every gap with fake numbers — a
 * hardcoded demo-orders table shown for every school regardless of which
 * one was open, and per-school KPI figures keyed off the school's name.
 * Removed: a dash or a stated gap is honest, but numbers that look real and
 * are not are actively misleading, worse than the gap they were covering.
