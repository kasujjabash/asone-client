/**
 * The dashboard's own API.
 *
 * A read-only aggregation app on the server, and the right source for this
 * screen — its README is explicit: "If a figure here disagrees with the
 * screen it came from, the other screen is right and this one has a bug."
 *
 * Worth using rather than adding up the underlying resources on the client,
 * for three reasons the client version got wrong:
 *
 *   Totals are computed server-side, so money is read rather than summed —
 *   which is what the brief asks for.
 *
 *   `order-volume/` is readable by the reporting roles. Counting orders per
 *   day from `/orders/school-orders/` is not: that endpoint answers 403 for
 *   both leads.
 *
 *   Every figure is one request instead of a page-capped roll-up.
