/**
 * Inventory adjustments and warehouse transfers — F23 to F27.
 *
 * Two resources that the design draws as one screen, kept apart here because
 * the server keeps them apart: an adjustment writes **one** ledger row and is
 * Finance only; a transfer writes **two**, one out and one in at the same
 * unit value, and both leads may raise it.
 *
 * Both are written in two steps — create, then post. Creating records the
 * intent and touches no stock; posting is the irreversible half. That split
 * exists so a correction can be checked against the shelf before it becomes
 * a permanent row, and the screens keep it visible rather than collapsing it
 * into one button that silently does both.
