/**
 * Procurement — production orders and the receipts against them.
 *
 * The receiving flow (F19, F20, F21) is **three calls, deliberately**, and
 * the screen has to keep them in that order:
 *
 *   outstandingOnOrder   what the order still expects, per SKU. The
 *                        "Expected" column, and the rows the clerk counts
 *                        against.
 *   createReceipt        records what actually arrived. **Does not touch
 *                        stock.**
 *   postReceipt          F21 — writes the ledger rows and raises stock.
 *                        Once only, and there is no way back: the ledger is
 *                        append-only, so a miscount is corrected with an
 *                        inventory adjustment, not by re-posting.
 *
 * Entering and posting are separate because AsOne's flow (p.5) has the
 * warehouse check the delivery against the Tailoring Center's handwritten
 * packing list and resolve differences *before* anything is committed. That
 * gap is the whole reason the compare step exists.
