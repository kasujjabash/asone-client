 *                          returns a challenge. **No tokens.**
 *   2. `verifyLoginCode`   challenge + code. Returns the token pair and the
 *                          user.
 *
 * A password alone is enough to read every school's orders and every
 * warehouse's stock, which is why the server stopped issuing tokens for one.
 *
 * Thin by design: one request and one type per function. No React, no
 * navigation, no storage decisions beyond handing tokens to `tokens`.
